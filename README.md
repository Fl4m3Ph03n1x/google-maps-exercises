# Google Maps Exercises

## Description

This repo contains the problems and solutions to the Google Maps training I did while working for Google Maps.

All the examples are front-ended (with no back-end code) and good to run right out of the box. Make sure to check the API Keys.

These exercises eventualy culminated in the creation of the [Marker Libs](https://github.com/Fl4m3Ph03n1x/MarkerLibs), a set of libraries with the purpose of facilitating the use of Google Map Markers and other services, such as the [Polyong + Marker Cluster](https://github.com/Fl4m3Ph03n1x/marker-cluster-polygon) demo. 

# Install and Usage

Simple clone the repo and run the `idnex.html` of each folder. Make sure to change the API Key to the one you are using.
